# timer in ix
We provide a hierarchical timing wheel implementation for managing network timeouts, such as TCP retransmissions. It is optimized for the common case where most timers are canceled before they expire.  We support extremely high-resolution timeouts, as low as 16Î¼s, which has been shown to improve performance during TCP incast congestion.

A timer event infrastructure
```
struct timer {
	struct hlist_node link;
	void (*handler)(struct timer *t, struct eth_fg *cur_fg);
	uint64_t expires;
	int fg_id;
};

struct timerwheel {
	uint64_t now_us;
	uint64_t timer_pos;
	struct hlist_head wheels[WHEEL_COUNT][WHEEL_SIZE];

};
```
In which timerwheel is declared per cpu variable.
And in delay procedure `rdtsc()` and `cpu_relax` are used to get cpu cycles and wait.
