# CPU mask
cpumask in linux is a bitmap to represent the set of CPU's in a system

## sth wrong
floating point in kernel
nr_cpus, cfg.xxx...
control plane
rdtsc cycle should not been used here
hlist differs
figure out a way to delete hrtimer
timer is still messing up
cfg_xxx replaced by actual cpu no.
cpu_nr replaced by processor_id, don't know if right
cpu_khz to replace cycles_per_us might be wrong
cpu_metric need ewma_init first when define
pkg_power and energy_unit set to unsigned long and mult 1000
BUG_ON except arp.c
addr in udp.c
